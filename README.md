# Simulating Phong Lighting with Interactive Camera Around a 3D Face

**Course:** Computer Graphics I (2024â€“2025)  
**Assignment:** Moving Phong Lighting  

*The application has been implemented and tested successfully in Visual Studio.*

---
## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `build` folder and open `LearnOpenGL.sln` with Visual Studio.

2. To view the simulation video, go to the `simulation_output-video` folder in the repository.

## Assignment Description

The application must load a 3D face model and simulate Phong lighting using a point light represented by a rotating sphere. Specifically, the requirements are:

- **Model Loading:**
  - Load `woman1.obj` using the `Model` class from LearnOpenGL.
- **Camera Controls:**
  - Horizontal translation with `A`/`D` keys (X axis).
  - Vertical translation with `W`/`S` keys (Y axis).
  - Rotation with mouse movement.
- **Exit:** Close the application with the `Esc` key.
- **Sphere (Light Source):**
  - Implemented via the `Sphere` class:
    - Setup of VAO, VBO, and EBO for vertices (position, normals, UVs).
    - Wireframe rendering and rotation in the Xâ€“Z plane around the face.
- **Shaders:**
  - Sphere vertex/fragment shaders for transforms and Phong lighting calculations.
  - Model vertex/fragment shaders for Phong illumination, with an option to use either solid color or texture.
- **Rotation Speed Control:**
  - Increase speed by 0.05 with `H`.
  - Decrease speed by 0.05 with `J` (clamped at zero).
  - Debounce mechanism to allow only one speed change per frame.

## Implementation

**Initial Build**

The project is based on the LearnOpenGL repository, limited to the `model_loading` example. A `build` folder was created and populated via CMake. In Visual Studio, the startup project was set to `3.model_loading__1.model_loading`.

**Implementation Steps**

1. **Model Loading & Camera:**
   - The `Model` class successfully loaded `woman1.obj` including normals and texture coordinates.
   - The `Camera` class was extended to handle WASD input for translation and mouse movement for rotation, with `Esc` closing the window.

2. **Sphere as Point Light:**
   - The `Sphere` class was implemented with adjustable division parameters and manages GPU buffer creation.
   - The sphere is rendered in wireframe mode and rotates around the face with a consistent angular speed.

3. **Shaders:**
   - Separate shaders were developed for the sphere and the model. Each vertex shader handles transformations, and the fragment shaders compute ambient, diffuse, and specular components.

4. **Speed Control & Debounce:**
   - The angular speed variable is adjusted via the `H`/`J` keys in increments of 0.05, clamped at zero, with a debounce to limit to one change per frame.

**Dependencies**

All required libraries (GLFW, GLAD, GLM, Assimp) are included within the `3.model_loading__1.model_loading` folder.
